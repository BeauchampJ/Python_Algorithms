# False Position
Finds the root of a function using false position method

---

## Description
Finds the root of a function using false position method


---

## Inputs
-   f = user inputs the function that they wish to have evaluated
-   xl = Users lower guess for the root
-   xu = Users upper guess for the root
-   es = Users desired relative error, Type as a percentage (defaults to 0.0001%)


---

## Outputs
-   root = Estimated root location
-   fx = function that got evaluated at said location of root
-   ea = approximate relative error (%)
-   it = the number of iterations which were preformed
